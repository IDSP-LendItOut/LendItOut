      <p>Welcome to LendItOut. By using this app, you agree to the following Terms of Service. Please read carefully before continuing. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old or have consent from a legal guardian to use this app. By signing up, you confirm that you meet this requirement.</p>

      <h2>2. Account Responsibility</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for creating a secure password and keeping it confidential, providing accurate and up-to-date information, and all activity that occurs under your account.</p>

      <h2>3. Our Role</h2>
      <p>LendItOut is a platform that allows users to rent, buy, and sell items. We are not the owner of listed items and do not guarantee their quality, safety, legality, or fitness for use.</p>

      <h2>4. Renting Items</h2>
      <p>If you are renting an item, you agree to use it responsibly, return it on time, and may be charged for late returns, damage, or loss. If you are listing an item, you agree to provide honest descriptions and inspect the item upon return. Any damage must be reported within 24 hours.</p>

      <h2>5. Buying and Selling</h2>
      <p>Sellers must describe items accurately and set fair prices. Buyers must pay before receiving items. All sales are final unless the seller states otherwise.</p>

      <h2>6. Payments</h2>
      <p>We use secure third-party payment systems. You agree to any applicable processing fees and authorize us to charge your payment method as needed.</p>

      <h2>7. Prohibited Activities</h2>
      <p>You agree not to break any laws or regulations, list illegal or dangerous items, post false, harmful, or inappropriate content, or use the app to spam, scam, or harass others.</p>

      <h2>8. Risk and Liability Waiver</h2>
      <p>All items are used at your own risk. LendItOut does not inspect, test, or guarantee the safety or condition of user-listed items. We are not liable for any injury, damage, or third-party claims resulting from your use of rented items.</p>

      <h2>9. Responsibility for Damages</h2>
      <p>You may be required to pay for repair or replacement if an item is lost, damaged, or misused. You agree to follow all instructions provided by the owner and to use items only as intended.</p>

      <h2>10. Rental Agreement Between Users</h2>
      <p>The lender confirms the item is in working condition at time of rental. The borrower agrees to return the item by the due date. Late returns may incur daily fees or result in full replacement charges. Lenders must inspect items within 24 hours of return. Borrowers agree to cover damage or loss. LendItOut is not a party to this agreement and is not responsible for disputes or item conditions.</p>

      <h2>11. Disputes</h2>
      <p>We are not responsible for resolving disputes between users but may step in at our discretion. All users are expected to communicate respectfully and honestly.</p>

      <h2>12. Suspension or Termination</h2>
      <p>We may suspend or terminate your account for violating these terms or misusing the platform.</p>

      <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the app means you accept any updated terms.</p>
